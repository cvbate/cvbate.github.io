**ABOUT ME:**  
Hello, thank you for visiting my portoflio website!
This Website was created and hosted on GitHub; I've really enjoying putting this website together, thank you for visiting! In the future I hope to offer two viewing language modes in English and Spanish. ¡Ojala que sea pronto!
  
My name is Clio Bate, I am currently pursing my MS in GIS at Clark University in Worcester, MA and expected to graduate this coming May- 2024. I went right into my masters degree after graduating from Smith College with a bachelors in Environmental Science and Policy with a focus on the human impact of climate change. I am interesting in Remote Sensing with applications in agriculture, climate change moitoring, land change, deforestation, and Urban Forestry all of which I have explored in my time at Clark.
  
My hobbies including reading— my favorite authors are Robin Hobb and Isabel Allende— hiking, traveling, spending time with friends, and hanging out with my cat, Loon.
