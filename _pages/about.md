ABOUT ME:  
Hello, thank you for visiting my portoflio website!
This Website was created and hosted on GitHub! --credit to original template-- I've really enjoying putting this website together.
  
My name is Clio Bate, I am currently pursing my MS in GIS at Clark University in Worcester, MA and expected to graduate this coming May- 2024. I went right into my masters degree after graduating from Smith College with a bachelors in Environmental Science and Policy with a focus on the human impact of climate change. I am interesting in Remote Sensing with applications in agriculture, climate change moitoring, deforestation, and Urban Forestry which I have explored in my time at Clark.  
   
My hobbies including reading— my favorite authors are Robin Hobb and Isabel Allende— hiking, traveling spending time with friends, and hanging out with my cat, Loon.
