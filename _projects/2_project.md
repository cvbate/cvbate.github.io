This project studied the growth of [Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs)](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/collections/3e7203cf44cf417c9b5fe1db7a182293?item=1) with André Luiz de Oliveira Domingues (Clark Universtiy, MSGIS) in Mexican's Yucatán peninsula. We identified CAFO's refuse lagoons from Landsat imagery by training a deep learning model to recognize CAFOs lagoons based on spectral sampling of known lagoons in 2019. We identied when the lagoons began to appear in  Sitilpech, Uayalceh, and Kinchil, and at what scale and rate they have grown since 1995. Our project was intended to add to previous research on CAFOs in Yucatán and support community claims of increasing, illegal, industrial swine operations in their territories.

Software/Packages used: R Studio, GitHub, Random Forest, rgee (package API for GEE)


Represent the data in R with maps and graphs that show the growth and distribution of CAFOS in the three communities.

    Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, _bled_ for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
</div>

The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

{% raw %}

```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
  <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
</div>
```

{% endraw %}
