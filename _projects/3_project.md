The objective of the research and report was to simulate gross gains and losses and attempt to simulate alternations for the time interval of 2000 to 2020 using temporary crop data from Bahia, Brazil in TerrSet’s Land Change Modeler (LCM). In this research, we use two sub-models: Logistic Regression(LR) and Multi-Layer-Perceptron (MLP).  
  
The following slides serve as a final product, a report to Clark Labs on the software issues encountered during the analysis, including striping/banding, masking, and other errors.​  
  
Due to the length of the final presentation, this page will feature an abridged version of the report.
